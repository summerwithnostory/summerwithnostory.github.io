      <description>Specimens of this fine Kingsfisher are contained in the British Museum, the Linnean Society, and my own collections, all of which were procured on the north-east coast of Australia, where it evidently replaces the Dacelo gigantea of New South Wales and South Australia.
 Leach&#39;s Kingfisher &amp;ndash; Project Gutenberg
  The specimen in the Linnean Society’s museum was presented by Dr. Brown1, who procured it in Keppel Bay on the east coast; and it was subsequently seen at Shoalwater Bay2 and Broad Sound on the same coast; my own specimens were obtained at Cape York, the north-eastern extremity of Australia.</description>
